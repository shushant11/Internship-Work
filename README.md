Skills4future Internship on Greenskills & AI
# Internship-Work
This repository documents my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of the Green Skills and AI course. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, applied various machine learning models, and explored essential tools like GitHub.
Learning Highlights
ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
Regression Models: Implemented Linear Regression for predictive analysis.
Classification Models: Worked with Decision Trees and Random Forest for classification tasks.
ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning
Clustering: Explored K-Means and other clustering techniques.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE for data visualization and feature reduction.
ðŸ”¹ Hands-on Experience
Engaged in quizzes and practical exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts.
Applied ML techniques to real-world datasets.
ðŸ”¹ Version Control with GitHub
Learned GitHub fundamentals from February 12th to February 20th.
Practiced repository management, branching, and collaboration workflows.
